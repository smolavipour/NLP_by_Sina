# Stock Market Chatbot

This project is a chatbot that understands human input and answers and plots appropriate results. 

[Link to the project](LLM_GenAI/StockmarketBot)

In this project we leverage ${\color{yellow}Langchain}$ and ${\color{yellow}Huggingface}$ endpoints to run LLMs. 
The task is broken down into multiple chains and agents to pick up relevant data. Then ${\color{yellow}yfinance}$ API is used to read stock market historical data.

This is an ongoing project!
