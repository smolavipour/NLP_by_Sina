# Small projects
## Stock market chatbot
This project is a chatbot that understands human input and answers and plots appropriate results. 
In this project we leverage **Lngchain** and **Huggingface** endpoints to run LLMs. 
The task is broken down into multiple chains and agents to pick up relevant data. Then **yfinance** API is used to read stock market historical data.

This is an ongoing project!
